# Find Your Path

The goal of this project is to create several web-based tools for PathFinder 2nd Edition. The planned tools are listed below. For now, there is a static version at: https://levitacus.github.io/Find-Your-Path/

### Monster Encounter Builder
A tool to add monsters to an encounter from a list. Will automatically generate a suitable encounter based on desired difficulty rating and party level.
ETA August 2020.

### Character Sheet
A tool to build a character like the PathBuilder App for Android devices. ETA Jan 2021?

My goal is to eventually make this its own website where you can log in, save encounters, share encounters, save characters, and share characters.
If there are any other suggestions, feel free to message me and I'll review the idea.

I may also build this as a serverless app and utilize AWS as a backend.
