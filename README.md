# Find Your Path

The goal of this project is to create several web-based tools for PathFinder 2nd Edition. The planned tools are listed below.

### Monster Encounter Builder
A tool to automatically generate a suitable encounter based on desired difficulty rating and party level. ETA Jan 2020.

### Character Sheet
A tool to build a character like the PathBuilder App for Android devices. ETA March 2020?

If there are any other suggestions, feel free to open an issue and I'll review the idea.
